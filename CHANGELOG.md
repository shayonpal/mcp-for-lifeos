## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-29

### Added
- **move_items tool**: Move notes and folders within the vault (#26)
  - Supports single item moves with `item` parameter
  - Supports batch operations with `items` array parameter
  - Auto-detects whether items are files or folders
  - Options for creating destination folders (`createDestination`)
  - Options for overwriting existing files (`overwrite`)
  - Options for merging folders (`mergeFolders`)
  - Comprehensive error handling and reporting
  - Prevents circular references when moving folders

### Changed
- **File Naming Convention**: Notes now preserve spaces and special characters in filenames (#25)
  - Spaces are no longer replaced with dashes
  - Most special characters are preserved (except square brackets, colons, and semicolons which Obsidian doesn't support)
  - Examples: "My Note Title" creates "My Note Title.md" instead of "My-Note-Title.md"
  - This applies to both `create_note` and `create_note_from_template` tools
