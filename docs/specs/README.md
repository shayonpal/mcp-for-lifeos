## Specification Lifecycle

### Status Definitions
- **Proposed**: Under consideration, gathering feedback
- **Approved**: Accepted for development, detailed planning
- **In Progress**: Active development underway
- **Implemented**: Feature complete, available in current version
- **Reference**: Historical documentation, feature complete

### From Idea to Implementation
1. **Feature Specs**: Start in `features/` with user requirements
2. **Implementation Plans**: Move to `implementation/` with technical details
3. **Use Cases**: Document in `use-cases/` with real-world scenarios
4. **Architecture Decisions**: Major choices documented in `../adr/`

## Current Development Focus

**Active Priority**: Core MCP server development (per ADR-002)
- Server decomposition and technical debt reduction
- Test suite health and reliability improvements
- Tool consolidation validation and legacy retirement

**Deferred**: New feature development pending technical debt resolution
