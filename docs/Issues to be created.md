**Labels**: research, architecture

## Issue 2
**Title**: Design API architecture for integrating multiple LLM providers
**Description**: Create a unified API architecture that can handle requests to Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenAI, and Perplexity. Design an abstraction layer to standardize the interface regardless of the provider being used.
**Labels**: architecture, backend

## Issue 3
**Title**: Create wireframes for multi-provider chat interface
**Description**: Design simple wireframes for a chat interface that supports multiple LLM providers. Include UI elements for provider selection, model selection, and API key management.
**Labels**: design, frontend

## Issue 4
**Title**: Implement chat interface with provider selection
**Description**: Develop a responsive chat UI with message input, response display, and clear conversation functionality. Include provider and model selection dropdowns that affect which API is used.
**Labels**: frontend, ui

## Issue 5
**Title**: Develop secure API key management interface
**Description**: Create UI components for entering, updating, and securely storing API keys for Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and Perplexity. Include validation and secure storage options.
**Labels**: frontend, security

## Issue 6
**Title**: Implement secure storage and handling of LLM provider API keys
**Description**: Create a secure system for storing and using API keys. Consider encryption at rest, scoping of keys to user sessions, and avoiding client-side exposure.
**Labels**: security, backend

## Issue 7
**Title**: Implement Anthropic Claude API integration with specific model support
**Description**: Create backend services to connect to Anthropic Claude API with support for the specific models `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` and `claude-3-7-sonnet-latest`. Include model selection UI and parameter configuration specific to these Claude versions.
**Labels**: backend, integration

## Issue 8
**Title**: Implement Google Gemini API integration with specific model support
**Description**: Create backend services to connect to Google Gemini API with support for `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` and `models/gemini-2.0-flash`. Note that the second model includes a path prefix that may need special handling in the API integration.
**Labels**: backend, integration

## Issue 9
**Title**: Implement OpenAI API integration with specific model support
**Description**: Create backend services to connect to OpenAI API with support for `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` and `gpt-4o-2024-11-20`. Ensure the interface can handle these specific model versions and their unique capabilities.
**Labels**: backend, integration

## Issue 10
**Title**: Implement Perplexity API integration for sonar-pro model
**Description**: Create backend services to connect to Perplexity API specifically for the `sonar-pro` model. Implement necessary authentication and request formatting for Perplexity's API structure.
**Labels**: backend, integration

## Issue 11
**Title**: Design flexible model selection system with fallback options
**Description**: Create a robust model selection system that can handle the specified future models while providing graceful fallbacks if these exact models aren't available via the API. Include functionality to map requested model names to available alternatives.
**Labels**: backend, architecture

## Issue 12
**Title**: Create model-specific parameter presets for advanced LLM configuration
**Description**: Develop a system for storing and applying optimal configuration presets for each specified model. Include UI for viewing and modifying these presets, with special attention to the unique capabilities of each specified model version.
**Labels**: frontend, backend, configuration

## Issue 13
**Title**: Implement model availability verification system
**Description**: Create functionality to verify the availability of specified models through API health checks. Implement a notification system to alert users when attempting to use models that may not yet be available or have been deprecated.
**Labels**: backend, error-handling

## Issue 14
**Title**: Develop robust error handling for LLM provider API calls
**Description**: Implement comprehensive error handling for API connectivity issues, rate limiting, authentication failures, and other potential errors from the LLM providers. Create user-friendly error messages.
**Labels**: backend, error-handling

## Issue 15
**Title**: Implement basic usage monitoring for LLM API calls
**Description**: Create a simple dashboard to track API usage across different providers, including request counts and estimated costs. Help users monitor their consumption.
