# ADR-001: OpenWebUI Integration Over Custom Web Interface

**Status**: Superseded by ADR-002  
**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Deciders**: Lead Developer  
**Technical Story**: Custom web interface vs OpenWebUI integration for LifeOS MCP Server

## Context and Problem Statement

The LifeOS MCP server needed a web interface for mobile/iPad access to Obsidian vault operations. With a custom web interface 80% complete, we had to decide whether to continue custom development (2-3 weeks) or pivot to OpenWebUI integration (1-2 days setup).

**Key Factors**:
- Custom interface required 2-3 weeks additional development
- OpenWebUI offered mature chat interface with native MCP support  
- Primary user optimization (single developer)
- Core value in MCP server, not interface development

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Criteria (Must-Have)
- **Functional Preservation**: All 18 LifeOS MCP tools must work correctly
- **Mobile Access**: iPad/mobile interface must be usable for primary workflows
- **Network Accessibility**: Local network access for multi-device usage
- **Setup Simplicity**: Installation and configuration must be straightforward
- **Data Integrity**: No risk to existing Obsidian vault data

### Secondary Criteria (Nice-to-Have)
- **Development Time Savings**: Minimize time to functional interface
- **Feature Richness**: Access to advanced chat/AI capabilities
- **Maintenance Burden**: Reduce ongoing development responsibility
- **Extensibility**: Future enhancement possibilities

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Complete Custom Web Interface
- **Pros**: Full UI/UX control, no external dependencies, custom LifeOS optimization
- **Cons**: 2-3 weeks development time, ongoing maintenance, feature parity gaps
- **Score**: 3.10/5

### Option 2: OpenWebUI Integration Only
- **Pros**: 1-2 days setup, professional UI, multi-LLM support, reduced maintenance
- **Cons**: Additional infrastructure dependency, less customization control
- **Score**: 4.25/5

### Option 3: OpenWebUI + Conditional PWA (Selected)
- **Pros**: Data-driven decisions, immediate OpenWebUI value, resource flexibility
- **Cons**: Potential PWA delay if needed, mobile experience limitations possible
- **Score**: 4.50/5

### Option 4: Minimal Custom Interface
- **Pros**: Faster than full custom, some customization control
- **Cons**: Still significant development time, ongoing maintenance
- **Score**: 2.90/5

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: OpenWebUI + Conditional PWA

**Rationale**:
- Quantitative analysis showed highest score (4.50/5) across weighted criteria
- 83% time savings (1-2 days vs 2-3 weeks)
- Low risk with maximum flexibility
- Data-driven approach to avoid premature optimization

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: OpenWebUI integration and mobile testing (1-2 weeks)
2. **Phase 2**: MCP tool optimization based on usage (2-3 weeks)
3. **Phase 3**: Conditional PWA decision after 4-week mobile evaluation

### Success Metrics
- All 18 LifeOS tools functional through OpenWebUI
- Mobile/iPad interface meets usability standards  
- Setup process documented and reproducible
- Integration time â‰¤ 4 days

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Time Savings**: Redirected 2-3 weeks to core MCP feature development
- **Professional UI**: Access to mature, community-supported interface
- **Advanced Features**: Multi-LLM support, conversation management
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Community handles UI/UX improvements

### Negative
- **Infrastructure Dependency**: Requires Docker and mcpo proxy
- **Limited Customization**: Less control over LifeOS-specific UI workflows
- **Learning Curve**: OpenWebUI configuration and optimization needed

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Performance Issues**: Benchmark mcpo proxy early, fallback to custom interface
- **Feature Gaps**: Comprehensive workflow testing, custom interface preserved
- **Configuration Complexity**: Detailed documentation, simplified setup alternatives

## Follow-up Actions

- [x] Set up OpenWebUI with Docker
- [x] Integrate mcpo proxy with LifeOS MCP server
- [x] Test all 18 MCP tools through OpenWebUI interface
- [x] Validate mobile/iPad experience
- [x] Archive custom interface development branch
- [ ] 4-week mobile experience evaluation
- [ ] Conditional PWA decision based on evaluation results
