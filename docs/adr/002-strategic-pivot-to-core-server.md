# ADR-002: Strategic Pivot to Core MCP Server Development

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Deciders**: Lead Developer, Strategic Review  
**Technical Story**: Deprioritize all web interface approaches in favor of core MCP server enhancement

## Context and Problem Statement

Following ADR-001's OpenWebUI integration and subsequent LinuxServer.io Obsidian web access evaluation, the project needed to decide on long-term strategic direction. Analysis revealed that both web interface approaches distracted from critical technical debt and core server capabilities.

**Key Factors**:
- Technical debt score: 7.8/10 (high debt)
- Test suite failure rate: 33% (3 of 9 suites failing)
- Monolithic files: index.ts (2,224 lines), vault-utils.ts (1,687 lines)
- Analytics data loss in concurrent instances
- 37 tools with inconsistent documentation

## Decision Drivers

### Critical Issues (P0-P1)
- **Test Suite Health**: 33% failure rate blocking development
- **Analytics Data Loss**: Concurrent instances overwrite metrics file
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Files violating single responsibility principle
- **Tool Consolidation**: Need validation of 21→11 tool consolidation

### Strategic Priorities
- **Maintainability**: Decompose monolithic structures
- **Reliability**: Achieve 100% test suite health
- **Performance**: Address large note editing latency
- **Documentation**: Complete tool reference for AI optimization

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Continue LinuxServer.io Evaluation
- **Pros**: Complete web interface evaluation, user testing
- **Cons**: Delays critical technical debt resolution, resource distraction
- **Risk**: High - technical debt compounds, development velocity decreases

### Option 2: Complete OpenWebUI Integration
- **Pros**: Leverage existing analysis and setup work
- **Cons**: Still requires significant integration effort, maintenance overhead
- **Risk**: Medium - opportunity cost of core server improvements

### Option 3: Strategic Pivot to Core Server (Selected)
- **Pros**: Address technical debt, improve reliability, focus on unique value
- **Cons**: Delay mobile access solutions, abandon completed analysis
- **Risk**: Low - builds on strong MCP server foundation

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: Strategic Pivot to Core MCP Server Development

**Rationale**:
- Technical debt prevents confident deployment and feature development
- MCP server represents the unique value proposition vs interface development
- Test failures block all development progress
- AI tool optimization (95% accuracy) validates core server approach

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (P0)
- Analytics concurrent instance data loss fix
- Critical test suite failures resolution

#### Phase 2: Architecture Decomposition (P1)
- Server decomposition: index.ts from 2,224 to <500 lines
- vault-utils.ts god class elimination
- Tool consolidation validation and legacy retirement

#### Phase 3: Enhancement (P2-P3)
- Fast note editing with JSON Patch
- Obsidian Tasks integration  
- Custom instructions system
- LlamaIndex semantic search integration

### Success Metrics
- Test suite: 100% passing
- Largest file: <500 lines
- Tool count: Reduced from 37 to ~11 tools
- Technical debt: 7.8/10 → 3.0/10
- Performance: <100ms for common operations

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Focus**: Concentrate resources on unique MCP server capabilities
- **Quality**: Address technical debt preventing reliable deployment
- **Performance**: Optimize core operations and eliminate bottlenecks
- **Maintainability**: Create sustainable architecture for future development

### Negative
- **Mobile Access**: Delayed solution for iPad/mobile workflows
- **Sunk Cost**: Abandon completed OpenWebUI integration analysis
- **User Experience**: Temporarily limited to desktop Obsidian + Claude Desktop

### Strategic Trade-offs
- **Short-term**: Less user-facing features, mobile access delay
- **Long-term**: Stronger foundation for sustainable development and advanced features

## Implementation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)
1. Fix analytics data loss with file locking and instance IDs
2. Decompose index.ts into focused modules
3. Implement rename tool while refactoring

### Short-term Goals (Month 1-2)  
4. Validate consolidated tools vs legacy implementations
5. Complete comprehensive tool documentation
6. Implement fast note editing with patch operations

### Long-term Vision (Quarter 1)
7. Integrate Obsidian Tasks querying and management
8. Add custom instructions system for personalized workflows
9. Implement LlamaIndex for semantic search capabilities

## Reversal Criteria

This decision should be reconsidered if:
- Technical debt cannot be reduced below 4.0/10 within 8 weeks
- Test suite health cannot be maintained above 90% consistently
- Core MCP server performance degrades significantly
- User feedback strongly demands mobile access over server improvements
