# Current Development Focus

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29 3:40 PM (EDT)  
**Current Branch:** master  
**Phase:** Request Handler Decomposition â€“ Infrastructure Delivered

---

## ðŸ”§ Active Work

**MCP-95: Request Handler Infrastructure** (Code complete â€“ infrastructure-only)

Context:

- Continuation of the decomposition series (MCP-6 server factory â†’ MCP-7 tool registry â†’ MCP-95 infrastructure) to pull request handling out of `src/index.ts`.
- Establishes `src/server/request-handler.ts` with factory, cached `isToolAllowed` validator, analytics wrapper, and an explicit empty-registry guard ahead of MCP-96/97.
- Updates contracts (`dev/contracts/MCP-95-contracts.ts`, MCP-38 max-results return type) and expands Jest coverage so downstream issues inherit the scaffolding.

- Status: âœ… Implementation staged on current branch; documentation updates in progress before merge.
- Testing: Jest 24 suites / 434 tests (4 skipped) passing locally (`npm test -- --watch=false`, Oct 29 2025 3:35 PM EDT).
- Key achievements:
  - Created dedicated request handler module and analytics wrapper with zero runtime regressions.
  - Introduced structured `ToolAvailabilityResult` usage via cached tool name sets per mode.
  - Added targeted unit/integration suites covering empty registry behavior and validation contract changes.
- Follow-up actions:
  - MCP-96 will populate consolidated handlers and relax the empty-registry guard.
  - MCP-97 will migrate legacy handlers and aliases into the new registry.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Up (Technical Debt Series)

- **MCP-96**: Populate request handler registry with consolidated tool implementations
  - Move `search`, `create_note`, and `list` handlers into `src/server/request-handler.ts`
  - Remove MCP-95 empty-registry guard once handlers are wired
  - Ensure analytics wrapper and version metadata integration remain intact

- **MCP-97**: Add legacy handlers and aliases to the registry
  - Preserve backward-compatible behavior for legacy tools and alias names
  - Confirm mode-based availability works identically after migration

- **Index.ts cleanup**: After MCP-96/97, remove residual handler code paths from `src/index.ts` so entry point delegates entirely to the factory

---

## ðŸš« Blocked/Deferred

- **MCP-9**: Reorganize tool implementations (Deferred)
  - Status: Blocked pending MCP-96/97 population of the new handler registry
  - Reason: Legacy handler migration must stabilize before broader reorganization
  - Decision: PR #105 remains closed; revisit once registry-backed routing ships
  - Linear: https://linear.app/agilecode-studio/issue/MCP-9
  - See PR #105 comments for full context

## âœ… Recent Completions (Last 3 Days)

**Decomposition Series:**

- **MCP-95**: Request handler infrastructure (current branch)
  - Created `src/server/request-handler.ts` with factory, analytics wrapper, and cached `isToolAllowed`
  - Added `dev/contracts/MCP-95-contracts.ts` and updated MCP-38 max-results return shape
  - Introduced focused unit & integration tests (registry remains empty by design)

- **MCP-7**: Extract tool registry from monolithic index.ts
  - PR #107 merged earlier this week
  - Created tool-registry.ts module (856 lines, 6 functions) and eliminated duplication
  - Reduced index.ts by 791 lines (-30.5%) with 17 unit tests hitting 100% coverage

- **MCP-6**: Extract MCP server factory
  - PR #104 merged earlier this week
  - Created mcp-server.ts factory module (238 lines) with 22 unit tests covering lifecycle flows
  - Established foundation leveraged by MCP-7 and MCP-95

**Cycle 8 Completion** (100% issue resolution):

- **MCP-65**: Fix remaining integration test suite failures
  - PR #103 merged 2 days ago
  - Fixed path handling, API compatibility, analytics configuration
  - All integration tests now passing

  - Created normalizePath() shared utility
  - Consolidated path normalization logic

- **MCP-89**: Consolidate .md extension stripping logic
  - PR #101 merged 2 days ago
  - Created path-utils.ts module
  - Technical debt reduction

- **MCP-63**: Fix template manager test failures
  - PR #100 merged 2 days ago
  - Fixed mock configurations
  - Added extension normalization support

**Release**: v2.0.1 (2 days ago)

## âœ… All Tests Passing (430/434)

**Last Run:** Oct 29, 2025 3:35 PM EDT (`npm test -- --watch=false`)

**Status:**

- 430 tests passing, 4 intentionally skipped (analytics long-tail + timezone edge case)
- Request handler unit/integration suites cover empty-registry behavior and mode validation

**Test Suites:**

- 24/24 test suites passing
- Mix of unit, integration, and stress coverage
- Run time: ~16 seconds on Mac mini dev hardware

**Core Functionality:** âœ… All validated

- Daily note workflows
- Template processing
- Search engine
- JSONL analytics
- MCP server factory
- Tool registry
- Path utilities
- Concurrent operations

## ðŸ“Š Project Health

**Code Quality:**

- Technical debt burn-down continues (MCP-6 + MCP-7 + MCP-95 delivered)
- Modular architecture spans server factory, tool registry, and handler infrastructure
- Test coverage comprehensive (430/434 passing, 24/24 suites)
- Zero known blocking bugs

**Development Velocity:**

- Cycle 8: 100% completion (all issues resolved)
- Post-cycle: Handler decomposition 75% complete (MCP-6âœ… MCP-7âœ… MCP-95âœ…, MCP-96/97 pending)
- PR workflow: Review â†’ Test â†’ Merge pattern remains stable

**Next Phase Focus:**

- Ship MCP-96 consolidated handler migration, then MCP-97 legacy handlers/aliases
- Remove remaining handler logic from `src/index.ts`
- Maintain green test suite and monitor analytics instrumentation
