### MCP-60: Configuration Flag to Hide Legacy LifeOS MCP Tools

**Branch:** `feature/mcp-60-add-configuration-flag-to-hide-legacy-lifeos-mcp-tools`  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** In Progress

**Problem:** MCP clients see both consolidated and legacy tool aliases, causing confusion

**Solution:** Add config flag to hide legacy aliases without code changes

**Tasks:**

1. Implement server flag (env var/config option)
2. Wire config through `.env`, `config.ts`, Codex `config.toml`
3. Update README + release notes with flag documentation
4. Define acceptance tests for both modes (legacy visible/hidden)
5. Verify with MCP clients (Codex, Claude Desktop)

**Note:** MCP-4 (Analytics) deferred pending test infrastructure decision

## ðŸ”œ Up Next

### Priority 1: HTTP Transport Foundation (Unblock 13 Issues)

Complete these 3 design/research issues to unblock all HTTP Transport work:

1. **MCP-42** (Urgent, 2-3h) - Research MCP SDK Streamable HTTP Support
   - Verify SDK version compatibility
   - Study official Streamable HTTP examples
   - Document implementation approach

2. **MCP-43** (High, 2-3h) - Design Session Management Architecture
   - Session ID generation strategy
   - Event store design
   - Resumability with Last-Event-ID

3. **MCP-44** (High, 2-3h) - Design Security Model
   - Origin validation
   - Authentication approach
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Rate limiting strategy

**Dependencies:** All 13 HTTP Transport implementation issues are blocked on these three

### Priority 2: Test Infrastructure Stabilization

**Project:** Test Infrastructure Stabilization (Next Cycle)  
**Parent Issue:** MCP-62 - Fix 28 pre-existing test failures

Sub-issues ready to work:

- **MCP-63** (High) - Fix template manager test failures (4 tests)
- **MCP-64** (High) - Fix daily note task workflow failures (3 tests)
- **MCP-65** (High) - Fix remaining integration test failures (21 tests)

**Current Test Status:** 249/278 passing (89.6%)
