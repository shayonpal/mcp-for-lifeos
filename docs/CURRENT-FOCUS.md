## üîß Active Work

**MCP-7: Extract Tool Registry** (COMPLETED - merged to master)

Context:

- Continuation of index.ts decomposition (MCP-6 ‚Üí MCP-7 ‚Üí MCP-8)
- Extracting tool registration logic into dedicated pure function module
- Second phase of modular architecture transformation

- Status: ‚úÖ PR #107 merged to master (just now)
- Testing: 17 unit tests added, all passing (382/386 total, 4 skipped)
- Key achievements:
  - Created src/server/tool-registry.ts (856 lines) with 6 exported pure functions
  - Reduced src/index.ts from 2,588 to 1,797 lines (-791 lines, -30.5%)
  - Eliminated 400 lines of duplication via shared constants
  - Added 17 contract files for type safety across MCP issues
  - 100% test coverage for new module
- Recent commits:
  - `3d61b6a` Merge pull request #107 (just now)
  - `abf7485` docs: address Copilot review suggestions (5 mins ago)
  - `905c213` chore: add contract files to version control (15 mins ago)
  - `b750dfe` refactor: extract tool registry from index.ts (3 hours ago)
- Outcome: Foundation for final decomposition phase (MCP-8)
- PR: https://github.com/shayonpal/mcp-for-lifeos/pull/107
- Linear: https://linear.app/agilecode-studio/issue/MCP-7

## üìã Next Up (Technical Debt Series)

Based on MCP-7 completion, final decomposition target:

- **MCP-8**: Extract request handlers to separate modules (P1)
  - Move handler implementations out of index.ts
  - Complete index.ts decomposition series
  - Finalize modular architecture transformation

---

## üö´ Blocked/Deferred

- **MCP-9**: Reorganize tool implementations (Deferred)
  - Status: Blocked pending MCP-8 completion
  - Reason: PR #105 conflicts with MCP-7 (tool registry extraction)
  - Decision: Close PR #105, reassess after MCP-8
  - Linear: https://linear.app/agilecode-studio/issue/MCP-9
  - See PR #105 comments for full context
