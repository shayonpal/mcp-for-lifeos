## ðŸ”§ Active Work

### MCP-8: Extract Request Handler (Completed)

**Branch:** master (merged)
**Project:** Server Decomposition + Rename Tool
**Priority:** High
**Status:** âœ… Complete - Pure factory pattern achieved

**Context:**

- Isolating request handling into src/server/request-handler.ts to centralize stdio call flow (tool dispatch, analytics, truncation, error translation)
- Strategic pivot to incremental extraction via 5 manageable sub-issues (MCP-95 through MCP-99) for lower risk and better progress tracking
- Using hybrid dispatch pattern during transition period
- Target: -697 lines (-39% reduction from index.ts)

**Recent Progress (Last 3 Days):**

- `b8d867e` MCP-99: Merged to master - pure factory pattern achieved (just now)
- `1f616d7` test: address Copilot review feedback for MCP-99 (30 min ago)
- `58efd04` refactor(mcp): remove switch statement, achieve pure factory pattern (1 hour ago)
- `7ca7e84` MCP-98: extract 9 always-available tool handlers into 3 modules (3 hours ago)
- `f27a3b9` MCP-95: request handler infrastructure (1 day ago)

**Sub-Issues Status:**

- âœ… MCP-95: Infrastructure (Completed)
- âœ… MCP-96: Consolidated Tools (Completed)
- âœ… MCP-97: Legacy Aliases (Completed)
- âœ… MCP-98: Always-Available Tools (Completed - 591 lines, 39% reduction)
- âœ… MCP-99: Switch Statement Removal (Completed - 417 lines, 57% reduction, 83% total)

**Achievement:**

- **Target Met:** index.ts reduced from 1,797 to 307 lines (within 1 line of 306-line target!)
- **Pure Factory Pattern:** 100% registry-based routing, zero inline tool logic
- **All Handlers Extracted:** 35+ tool handlers now in dedicated modules

**Completion Summary:**

- âœ… All 5 sub-issues completed and merged to master
- âœ… Pure factory pattern achieved (100% registry-based routing)
- âœ… index.ts reduced from 1,797 to 307 lines (83% reduction)
- âœ… Linear issue MCP-99 closed as Done

**Next Focus:**

- MCP-2: rename_note tool implementation
- MCP-94: Integration test for unique instance ID generation
- Continue test infrastructure improvements

### MCP-94: Integration Test for Unique Instance ID Generation (In Progress)

**Branch:** feature/mcp-94-integration-test-for-unique-instance-id-generation-across  
**Project:** Test Infrastructure Stabilization  
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** PR #106 ready for review  
**Assignee:** Shayon Pal  
**Delegate:** GitHub Copilot

**Context:**

- Create comprehensive integration test validating that each MCP server instance generates a unique instance ID on startup
- Currently skipped test in tests/integration/jsonl-final-validation.test.ts needs implementation

**Status:** GitHub Copilot completed implementation on Oct 28. PR #106 created and ready for review.

**PR:** https://github.com/shayonpal/mcp-for-lifeos/pull/106

  - Parent: MCP-17
  - Foundation for custom instructions
  - Create config-manager and instruction-processor

- **MCP-92**: Implement hot-reload custom instructions
  - Parent: MCP-17
  - Final step, depends on MCP-90/91

- **MCP-17**: Custom Instructions Configuration and VaultUtils Elimination
  - Parent epic for vault-utils decomposition
  - 3 sub-issues: MCP-90, MCP-91, MCP-92

### Backlog Highlights

- **MCP-104 to MCP-101**: Node Runtime Migration (Homebrew Node@20.19.5)
  - 4-issue sequence for upgrading to Node 20.19.5 via Homebrew with rollback capability

- **MCP-22 to MCP-30**: Analytics Infrastructure
  - Multi-instance safety, client identification, centralized analytics pattern

- **MCP-18, MCP-19**: LlamaIndex RAG Search POC
  - Semantic search exploration with GPT-4o-mini and text-embedding-3-large
