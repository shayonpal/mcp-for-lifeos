# Current Development Focus

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29 7:10 PM (EDT)  
**Current Branch:** feature/mcp-96-consolidated-handler-registry  
**Phase:** Request Handler Decomposition â€“ Consolidated Handlers In Progress

---

## ðŸ”§ Active Work

**MCP-96: Consolidated Handler Registry** (In review/testing)

Context:

- Populates the request-handler factory with consolidated tools (`search`, `create_note`, `list`) via `registerConsolidatedHandlers`.
- Moves consolidated implementations into `src/server/handlers/consolidated-handlers.ts` and adds `UnknownToolError` contracts for hybrid fallback.
- Updates `src/index.ts` to delegate execution through the registry while refreshing analytics client context per request.

- Status: ðŸš§ Code + tests staged on feature branch; wrapping documentation before review.
- Testing: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test -- request-handler` (2 suites / 38 tests) all green as of Oct 29 2025 7:10 PM EDT.
- Key achievements:
  - Consolidated tool requests now execute through analytics-aware handlers registered at factory creation.
  - Added `dev/contracts/MCP-96-contracts.ts` with `MutableToolHandlerRegistry`, `RequestHandlerWithClientContext`, and `UnknownToolError`.
  - Simplified `src/index.ts` hybrid dispatch, ensuring client metadata stays in sync for analytics.
- Follow-up actions:
  - Validate legacy fallback path once MCP-97 migrates classic handlers and aliases.
  - Address ts-jest `isolatedModules` warning post-merge (tsconfig update) ahead of v30 release.
  - Coordinate release notes for consolidated handler milestone.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Up (Technical Debt Series)

- **MCP-97**: Add legacy handlers and aliases to the registry
  - Preserve backward-compatible behavior for legacy tools and alias names
  - Confirm mode-based availability works identically after migration

- **Index.ts cleanup**: After MCP-96/97, remove residual handler code paths from `src/index.ts` so entry point delegates entirely to the factory

---

## ðŸš« Blocked/Deferred

- **MCP-9**: Reorganize tool implementations (Deferred)
  - Status: Blocked pending MCP-96/97 population of the new handler registry
  - Reason: Legacy handler migration must stabilize before broader reorganization
  - Decision: PR #105 remains closed; revisit once registry-backed routing ships
  - Linear: https://linear.app/agilecode-studio/issue/MCP-9
  - See PR #105 comments for full context

## âœ… Test & Quality Snapshot

**Last Run:** Oct 29, 2025 7:10 PM EDT (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test -- request-handler`)

**Status:**

- Targeted request-handler suites (2/2) green; consolidated registry scenarios validated end-to-end.
- `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` remain clean; npm vs. Node version warning acknowledged.
- Prior full-suite picture (Oct 29 2025 4:20 PM EDT) still shows one failing JSONL stress harness; no change pending legacy handler work.

**Test Suites:**

- Request-handler focus: 38 tests passing (unit + integration), 0 failures.
- Full suite baseline unchanged: JSONL stress harness continues to exceed memory guard; revisit post-MCP-97.

**Core Functionality:** âœ… Daily note workflows, template processing, search engine, analytics logging, MCP server factory, tool registry, request handler infrastructure

**Known exception:** ðŸŸ¥ JSONL stress harness currently exceeds memory guard threshold; investigation deferred until consolidated handler rollout (MCP-96/97) completes.

## ðŸ“Š Project Health

**Code Quality:**

- Technical debt burn-down continues (MCP-6 + MCP-7 + MCP-95 delivered)
- Modular architecture spans server factory, tool registry, and handler infrastructure
- Test coverage comprehensive (430/434 passing, 24/24 suites)
- Zero known blocking bugs

**Development Velocity:**

- Cycle 8: 100% completion (all issues resolved)
- Post-cycle: Handler decomposition 75% complete (MCP-6âœ… MCP-7âœ… MCP-95âœ…, MCP-96/97 pending)
- PR workflow: Review â†’ Test â†’ Merge pattern remains stable

**Next Phase Focus:**

- Ship MCP-96 consolidated handler migration, then MCP-97 legacy handlers/aliases
- Remove remaining handler logic from `src/index.ts`
- Maintain green test suite and monitor analytics instrumentation
