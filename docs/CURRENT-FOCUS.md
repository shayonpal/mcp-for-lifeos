**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23
**Cycle:** Cycle 8 (Oct 20-27, 2025)
**Progress:** 75% complete (9/12 issues done)

## ðŸŽ¯ Active Work

### Primary: Error Message Enhancement (MCP-39)

**Branch:** `feature/mcp-39-enhance-all-error-messages-with-suggested-next-steps-and`
**Priority:** High
**Status:** In Progress (Implementation phase)

**Objective:** Transform error messages from simple diagnostics into actionable guidance for AI agents.

**Current Phase:** Implementing pattern-based error messages at 5 error sites:
1. `src/template-engine.ts:147` - Template not found (LIST_OPTIONS pattern)
2. `src/vault-utils.ts:225` - Note not found by path (SUGGEST_SEARCH pattern)
3. `src/vault-utils.ts:2342` - Note not found by title (SUGGEST_SEARCH pattern)
4. `src/vault-utils.ts:1174` - Auto-managed field violation (REFERENCE_TOOL pattern)
5. `src/vault-utils.ts:1180` - Invalid YAML field (REFERENCE_TOOL pattern)

**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Implement 5 error message enhancements
- [ ] Manual Claude Desktop testing
- [ ] Update tool documentation
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Create PR and merge

**Estimated:** 6 hours (implementation + testing + docs)

## ðŸ“‹ Cycle Plan vs Reality

### Linear Cycle 8 Plan
**Primary Theme:** HTTP Transport Implementation (17 issues)
**Secondary Theme:** MCP Improvements (3 issues)

### Current Execution
**Active:** MCP-39 (Error messages) - High priority MCP improvement
**Deferred:** HTTP Transport work - blocked on foundational design issues

**Rationale for Deviation:**
- HTTP Transport issues have dependency chain (MCP-42 â†’ MCP-43/44 â†’ MCP-45 â†’ all others)
- Foundation research and design not yet complete
- MCP-39 is unblocked and provides immediate user experience value
- Can complete MCP-39 while HTTP Transport design work happens

---

## ðŸ”œ Up Next (After MCP-39)

### Immediate Queue
1. **MCP-40** (Medium) - TypeScript interfaces for tool inputs
   - Improve type safety across MCP tools
   - Low risk, high value for developer experience

### HTTP Transport Track (When Unblocked)
1. **MCP-42** (Urgent) - Research MCP SDK Streamable HTTP Support
2. **MCP-43** (High) - Design Session Management Architecture
3. **MCP-44** (High) - Design Security Model

These foundational issues must be completed before the rest of HTTP Transport work can proceed.

---

## âœ… Recent Completions

- **PR #94** (2025-10-23) - Documentation restructuring with lean README
- **MCP-61** (2025-10-22) - Fixed integration test vault pollution
- **MCP-59** (2025-10-22) - Multi-word search implementation
- **MCP-91** (Earlier) - Token limit with smart truncation (~25K response budget)

---

## ðŸš« Deferred/Blocked

### HTTP Transport Project (17 issues)
**Status:** All blocked waiting for foundation
**Blocker:** Need to complete MCP-42 (research), MCP-43 (session design), MCP-44 (security design)
**Timeline:** TBD based on research and design completion

### Web Interface Projects
**Status:** All deferred
**Includes:** OpenWebUI, LinuxServer.io, custom PWA approaches
**Rationale:** Focus on core MCP server stability and functionality
