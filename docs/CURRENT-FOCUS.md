## üéØ Active Work

**Test Infrastructure Stabilization** - Final push to complete Cycle 8

### Priority: Fix Remaining Test Suite Failures (4 issues)

1. **MCP-62** (High) - Fix pre-existing test suite failures (parent issue)
   - 28 tests failing across 9 suites
   - Sub-issues: MCP-64, MCP-65, MCP-89

2. **MCP-89** (Medium) - Consolidate .md extension stripping logic
   - NEW issue created Oct 26 as follow-up to MCP-63
   - 5 instances across 3 files to consolidate

3. **MCP-64** (High) - Fix daily note task workflow test failures (3 tests)

4. **MCP-65** (High) - Fix remaining integration test suite failures

### Cycle 8 Progress Summary

**85% Complete** - 22 of 26 issues delivered:

**Major Projects Completed:**

- ‚úÖ **Serena Memory System Optimization** (7 issues: MCP-74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 88)
  - Consolidated ~66 memory files ‚Üí ~10-12 reusable pattern files
  - Created architecture_patterns.md, testing_guide.md, documentation_workflow.md
  - Eliminated all issue-specific and historical memories

- ‚úÖ **Test Infrastructure Stabilization** (MCP-63 merged Oct 26)
  - Fixed 4 template manager test failures
  - All 12 template manager tests passing

- ‚úÖ **HTTP Transport Research** (MCP-42, MCP-44 completed, project deferred)
  - Streamable HTTP transport research documented
  - Security model designed
  - Decision: Project deferred per user direction

## üìä Cycle Plan vs Reality

### Planned vs Actual: 85% Complete

**Planned:** 26 issues across 3 major projects  
**Delivered:** 22/26 issues (85% completion rate)  
**Remaining:** 4 test infrastructure issues (due tomorrow)

**Key Projects:**

1. Serena Memory System Optimization - ‚úÖ Complete (7/7 issues)
2. Test Infrastructure Stabilization - üîÑ In progress (1/5 issues complete: MCP-63 done, 4 remaining)
3. HTTP Transport - ‚úÖ Research complete, implementation deferred

**Status:** Final sprint to complete test suite stabilization before cycle end

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Post-Cycle 8 Planning

**After test suite stabilization completes:**

1. Cycle 9 planning session
2. Backlog grooming and prioritization
3. Evaluate server decomposition priorities (MCP-6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
4. Analytics improvements assessment (MCP-22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30)
5. Configuration enhancements review (MCP-80, 81)

**Strategy:** Complete all 4 test infrastructure issues before starting Cycle 9
