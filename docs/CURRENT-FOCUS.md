**Assignee:** Shayon Pal
**Delegate:** GitHub Copilot

**Context:**

- Create comprehensive integration test validating that each MCP server instance generates a unique instance ID on startup
- Currently skipped test in tests/integration/jsonl-final-validation.test.ts needs implementation

**Status:** GitHub Copilot completed implementation on Oct 28. PR #106 created and ready for review.

**PR:** https://github.com/shayonpal/mcp-for-lifeos/pull/106

**Action:** Code review and merge - quick win to close out

## ðŸ“‹ Planned Work (This Cycle)

### Immediate Queue (Recommended Order)

1. **MCP-2**: Add rename_note tool for changing note titles and filenames
   - Priority: High
   - Project: Server Decomposition + Rename Tool
   - Includes link-update infrastructure
   - Builds on modular architecture from MCP-8

2. **MCP-94**: Review and merge PR #106 (integration test)
   - Priority: Low (but quick win)
   - Already implemented by GitHub Copilot
   - Close out test infrastructure work

### Integration & Cleanup

- **MCP-10**: Integration and cleanup
  - Project: Server Decomposition + Rename Tool
  - Final hardening pass after MCP-9 and MCP-2
  - Wait until tool reorganization complete

### Medium Priority

- **MCP-100**: Investigate intermittent memory spike in jsonl-stress integration test
  - Surfaced during MCP-95 validation
  - Single transient failure in jsonl-stress.test.ts

- **MCP-93**: Add 'last weekday' natural language date parsing support
  - Optional enhancement for date resolver
  - Currently skipped test

- **MCP-17**: Custom Instructions Configuration and VaultUtils Elimination
  - Parent epic for vault-utils decomposition
  - 3 sub-issues: MCP-90, MCP-91, MCP-92

  - **MCP-90**: Extract config & instruction scaffolding from vault-utils
  - **MCP-91**: Decompose vault-utils into domain modules
  - **MCP-92**: Implement hot-reload custom instructions

### Backlog Highlights

- **MCP-104 to MCP-101**: Node Runtime Migration (Homebrew Node@20.19.5)
  - 4-issue sequence for upgrading to Node 20.19.5 via Homebrew with rollback capability

- **MCP-22 to MCP-30**: Analytics Infrastructure
  - Multi-instance safety, client identification, centralized analytics pattern

- **MCP-18, MCP-19**: LlamaIndex RAG Search POC
  - Semantic search exploration with GPT-4o-mini and text-embedding-3-large

## âœ… Recent Completions (Last 3 Days)

### Decomposition Series Complete âœ…

**MCP-9: Reorganize Tool Implementations** (Completed - Oct 30, 2025)

- **Achievement**: All tool handler extraction and organization completed via MCP-98 and MCP-99
- **Impact**: Handlers organized in `src/server/handlers/` (5 modules, ~1,607 lines)
- **Result**: index.ts reduced from 2,588 to 338 lines (87% reduction)
- **Organization**: Consolidated, legacy-alias, metadata, note, and utility handlers in dedicated modules
- **Status**: All objectives achieved - switch statement removed, 100% registry-based routing
- **Branch**: N/A (completed via MCP-98/99 implementation path)
- **Alternative Approach**: Used `src/server/handlers/` instead of `src/tools/` for better architectural coherence
- **PR #105**: Closed due to conflict with MCP-7; superseded by MCP-98/99 implementation

**MCP-8: Extract Request Handler** (Completed - Oct 30, 2025)

- **Achievement**: Pure factory pattern with 100% registry-based routing
- **Impact**: index.ts reduced from 1,797 to 307 lines (83% reduction)
- **Result**: Exceeded 500-line target by 39% (achieved 307 vs 500 target)
- **All 5 sub-issues completed**: MCP-95 through MCP-99
- **Project**: Server Decomposition + Rename Tool

**MCP-99: Switch Statement Removal** (Completed - Oct 30, 2025)

- Deleted 418-line switch statement from index.ts, achieving pure factory pattern

- Simplified hybrid dispatch by removing unnecessary mode checks
- Reduced index.ts from 724 to 307 lines (-417 lines, -57% from pre-MCP-99, -83% from original)
- Achieved target of 306 lines (actual: 307, within 1 line!)
- All 35+ tool handlers now in dedicated modules with 100% registry-based routing
- Test results: 449/454 tests passing (99.1%)
