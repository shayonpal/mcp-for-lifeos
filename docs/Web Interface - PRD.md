## Non-Functional Requirements

### Security
- All API keys must be securely stored
- No sensitive information should be exposed in client-side code

- Chat responses should be streamed when supported by the provider
- UI should remain responsive during API calls

### Compatibility
- Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Responsive design that works well on desktop, iPad, and mobile devices
- Optimized for touch interfaces

### Reliability
- Graceful error handling for API failures
- Offline indicators when connectivity is lost
- Recovery mechanisms for interrupted sessions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Anthropic-Only)

The MVP will focus on creating a functional web interface with the following features:

- **Single Provider Support**: Anthropic Claude integration only
  - Support for Claude-3-Sonnet and Claude-3.5-Sonnet models
  - Streaming response capability

  - Installable on iOS devices (iPad, iPhone)
  - Offline capability with service workers
  - Home screen installation

- **Core Chat Interface**
  - Clean, minimalist design
  - Session-based message history
  - Markdown rendering for responses
  - Loading indicators

- **API Key Management**
  - Simple client-side storage via localStorage
  - Key validation on first use

- **Local Network Access**
  - Available on Mac Mini at http://10.0.0.140:9000
  - Optional mDNS support for easier discovery

### Phase 2: Full Implementation

After the MVP is established, the full implementation will add:

- **Multi-Provider Support**: All planned LLM providers
- **Advanced API Key Management**: Secure server-side storage
- **Model Configuration**: Parameter customization and presets
- **Usage Monitoring**: Basic analytics dashboard

## Future Considerations (Not in Initial Scope)

- Persistent chat history with searchable archives
- User accounts and personalization
- Fine-tuning or training interfaces
- File upload capabilities for document processing
- Voice input/output integration

## Technical Constraints

- Must operate on the local network (Mac Mini static IP: 10.0.0.140)
- Should integrate with the existing MCP-for-LifeOS codebase
- Minimize external dependencies to reduce complexity
- Prioritize lightweight, efficient implementations
- Web interface will run on port 9000 to avoid conflicts with other services
