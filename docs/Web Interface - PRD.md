# Product Requirements Document: MCP-for-LifeOS Web Interface

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a web interface for the MCP-for-LifeOS system, with a focus on integrating multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers. The interface will allow users to interact with various LLM providers through a unified chat interface.

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-05-26

## Goals

- Create a responsive web interface for accessing MCP functionality
- Integrate multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenAI, Perplexity)
- Provide a seamless user experience across devices, especially iPad
- Minimize development complexity while maintaining essential functionality

## User Personas

1. **Primary User:** Owner of the MCP-for-LifeOS system accessing the interface from various devices on the local network
2. **Secondary Users:** Household members or authorized users with access to the local network

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Provider LLM Chat Interface

#### Description
A unified chat interface that allows interaction with multiple LLM providers through a single UI.

#### Requirements
- Clean, minimalist chat interface with message input and response display
- Provider selection dropdown (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Perplexity)
- Model selection dropdown (dynamically populated based on provider)
- Clear conversation button (no persistent chat history required)
- Visual indicators for processing state

### 2. LLM Provider Integration

#### Description
Backend services that connect to various LLM provider APIs and handle the communication between the MCP and these services.

#### Requirements
- **Anthropic Claude Integration**
  - Support for models: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` and `claude-3-7-sonnet-latest`
  - API parameter configuration specific to Claude models

- **Google Gemini Integration**
  - Support for models: `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` and `models/gemini-2.0-flash`
  - Handle path prefix in model identifiers if needed

- **OpenAI Integration**
  - Support for models: `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` and `gpt-4o-2024-11-20`
  - API parameter configuration specific to OpenAI models

- **Perplexity Integration**
  - Support for the `sonar-pro` model
  - API parameter configuration specific to Perplexity

### 3. API Key Management

#### Description
Secure system for managing API keys for different LLM providers.

#### Requirements
- Form interface for entering API keys for each provider
- Secure storage of API keys (encrypted at rest)
- Client-side validation of API key format
- Option to test API key validity
- Clear indication of which providers are configured

### 4. Model Selection & Configuration

#### Description
System for selecting and configuring LLM models from each provider.

#### Requirements
- Default model selection for each provider
- Model availability verification
- Fallback options for unavailable models
- Provider-specific parameter configuration (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
- Ability to save and load parameter presets

### 5. Usage Monitoring

#### Description
Basic dashboard for monitoring API usage across different providers.

#### Requirements
- Display request counts by provider
- Estimated cost tracking where applicable
- Basic usage statistics (average response time, token counts)
- Simple visualizations of usage patterns
- Export functionality for usage data

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Security
- All API keys must be securely stored
- No sensitive information should be exposed in client-side code
- Implement basic authentication for accessing the web interface

### Performance
- Interface should load within 2 seconds on the local network
- Chat responses should be streamed when supported by the provider
- UI should remain responsive during API calls

### Compatibility
- Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Responsive design that works well on desktop, iPad, and mobile devices
- Optimized for touch interfaces

### Reliability
- Graceful error handling for API failures
- Offline indicators when connectivity is lost
- Recovery mechanisms for interrupted sessions

## Future Considerations (Not in Initial Scope)

- Persistent chat history with searchable archives
- User accounts and personalization
- Fine-tuning or training interfaces
- File upload capabilities for document processing
- Voice input/output integration

## Technical Constraints

- Must operate on the local network
- Should integrate with the existing MCP-for-LifeOS codebase
- Minimize external dependencies to reduce complexity
- Prioritize lightweight, efficient implementations

## Success Metrics

- Successful integration with all specified LLM providers
- Response time comparable to direct API usage
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal explanation
- Reliable operation with proper error handling
