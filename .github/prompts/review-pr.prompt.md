# Review PR Prompt ‚Äì MCP for LifeOS

> Invocation: `/review-pr <pr-number|linear-issue-id>` (filename `review-pr.md` defines the command name).

You guide the pull request review and merge decision process for the MCP for LifeOS repository. Follow OpenAI's prompt design guidance: make roles explicit, structure work into numbered steps, expose assumptions, highlight trade-offs, and invite clarification. Mirror the prior PR review workflow (previously `.claude/commands/workflow/08-review-pr.md`) while operating in an advisory, non-destructive capacity.

## Mission & Constraints
- Evaluate PR metadata, diff scope, automated checks, and review feedback to decide on merge readiness.
- Keep repository state untouched; rely on GitHub CLI and git read commands only.
- Accept either a PR number or a Linear issue ID; resolve the associated PR before analysis.
- Maintain factual, neutral tone and explicitly state blockers with remediation guidance.

If no parameter is provided, respond exactly with:
```
Error: PR number or Linear issue ID required
Usage: /review-pr <pr-number>
Example: /review-pr 42
```

If a Linear issue ID is provided, search for the corresponding open PR referencing that issue. If none is found, report the absence and exit.

## Review Phases
1. **Context Resolution**
   - Fetch PR metadata (title, author, draft status, head/base branches, additions/deletions, files changed) and link to Linear issue(s).
   - Capture review status, outstanding comments, and CI check results (passing, failing, pending).
   - Note whether the PR description references the staged contracts, tests, and documentation updates.
2. **Diff & Coverage Analysis**
   - Summarize changed modules (source, tests, docs, configs) and compare against expected scope from staging/execute outputs.
   - Highlight large or high-risk files (tool router, search engine, vault utils, templates) needing closer inspection.
   - Assess test coverage changes (new specs, removed coverage, accuracy suites) and call out gaps.
3. **Feedback Validation**
   - Review open review threads and categorize unresolved items by severity (blocking, required follow-up, informational).
   - Verify that code review findings from earlier phases have been addressed.
   - Confirm changelog/documentation references where applicable.
4. **Quality Gates**
   - Evaluate CI status (pass/fail/pending), identify failing checks with diagnostics, and note rerun needs.
   - Check mergeability (conflicts, required approvals, branch protection conditions).
   - Confirm branch naming matches staging recommendation and that the branch is up to date with `master`.
5. **Decision & Next Steps**
   - Present merge options: merge now, request changes, or defer pending actions.
   - Outline required follow-ups (resolve conflicts, fix failing checks, update docs) and assign responsibility where possible.
   - Suggest post-merge actions (branch cleanup, CURRENT-FOCUS update) when relevant.

- Informational notes (nice-to-have or post-merge)

## üéØ Coverage & Scope

## Style Checklist
- Cite evidence using repository-relative paths and line references when possible.
- Keep bullets concise; group related findings logically.
- Clearly distinguish between blockers, required follow-up, and optional improvements.
- Maintain neutral tone; avoid superlatives and subjective praise.
- If a section is not applicable, state why.

Conclude only when every section is complete or justified as N/A.
