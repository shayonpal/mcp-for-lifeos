# Next Session Instructions - 2025-06-28

## Session Summary
- **Duration**: ~2 hours  
- **Main focus**: Fixed two critical bugs - date resolution (#87) and section targeting (#88)
- **Issues worked**: #87 (Date resolution diagnostics), #88 (Section targeting improvements)

## Current State
- **Branch**: master
- **Uncommitted changes**: None - all work committed and pushed
- **Work in progress**: None - both issues completed

## Completed Today
- ✅ Investigated issue #87 - found DateResolver from #86 was working correctly
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging to DateResolver for diagnostics
- ✅ Created timezone edge case tests (10 new tests, all passing)
- ✅ Closed issue #87 with investigation findings
- ✅ Investigated issue #88 - section targeting for "Day's Notes"
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with heading suggestions
- ✅ Added section targeting tests (12 new tests, all passing)
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript error in insert_content logging
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG with both fixes

## Next Priority
1. **Issue #89** - User indicated this is next priority
2. **Fix failing integration tests** - tool-parity.test.ts has multiple failures
3. **Consider v1.8.0 release** - Many improvements since v1.7.0

## Future Consideration: Issue #85 - Obsidian Tasks Plugin Integration
**Not for next session, but worth understanding the context:**

Issue #85 proposes adding comprehensive Obsidian Tasks plugin integration with support for 20+ bullet journal task types. Key highlights:

- **Single unified `tasks` tool** with actions: list, get, update, create
- **Complete bullet journal support**: [ ], [x], [/], [-], [>], [<], [?], [!], [*], ["], [l], [b], [i], [S], [I], [p], [c], [u], [d]
- **Rich filtering**: by status, dates, priority, tags, folders
- **Task metadata**: creation, scheduled, due, done dates
- **Cross-vault visibility**: Query tasks across entire vault efficiently

This would be a significant enhancement for task management workflows but requires substantial implementation work. Consider this after current priorities are addressed.

## Important Context
- **DateResolver**: Working correctly but enhanced with logging for future debugging
- **Section Targeting**: Core functionality fine, but tool callers needed better guidance
- **Test Coverage**: Added 22 new tests total across both issues
- **Production Ready**: Both fixes are non-breaking and improve diagnostics

## Technical Details to Remember
- DateResolver uses date-fns-tz for proper timezone handling
- Section heading matching is case-sensitive and requires exact match
- "Day's Notes" (with apostrophe) is the standard daily note heading
- Enhanced error messages now suggest similar headings when not found

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Continue where left off
cd /Users/shayon/DevProjects/mcp-for-lifeos
git status

# Check issue #89
gh issue view 89

# Run failing tests
npm test -- tests/integration/tool-parity.test.ts

# If releasing v1.8.0
npm version minor
git push --tags
```

## Session Notes
- Both issues turned out to be more about improving diagnostics than fixing bugs
- The DateResolver implementation from #86 is solid
- Tool callers need clear documentation about exact requirements
- All new tests provide good coverage for edge cases
