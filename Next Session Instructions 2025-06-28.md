- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG with fix details
- ✅ Code formatted with Prettier
- ✅ Successfully deployed to master branch
- ✅ Issue #89 automatically closed on GitHub

## Next Priority
1. **Issue #90** - Fix tasks being inserted at top of list instead of bottom in daily notes
   - User expects tasks to be appended to bottom of existing task lists
   - Currently they appear at the top which disrupts chronological order
   - Need to modify the insert_content logic for "end-of-section" positioning

2. **Thorough Testing of Issues #86-90** - Test all recent task-related fixes together
   - Daily note template consistency (#86)
   - Date resolution diagnostics (#87) 
   - Section targeting improvements (#88)
   - Task creation date formatting (#89)
   - Task insertion positioning (#90)

3. **Release v1.8.0** - Once #90 is resolved and #86-90 are thoroughly tested together
   - Significant improvements warrant a minor version bump
   - Will include all task-related fixes and enhancements
   - Update version in package.json
   - Create comprehensive release notes
   - Tag and push release

## Important Context
- The task formatting system now automatically adds creation dates using the formatTaskWithCreationDate() method in VaultUtils
- Property order is maintained: ➕ created, 🛫 start, ⏳ scheduled, 📅 due, 🔁 recurrence
- All task-related issues (#86-90) are interconnected and affect daily note workflows
- The "end-of-section" logic currently finds the last list item but may need adjustment for chronological ordering

## Technical Details to Remember
- VaultUtils.insertContent() now includes task formatting logic
- The findLastListItem() method determines where tasks are inserted
- Task detection uses isTask() helper method checking for "- [ ]" pattern
- Integration tests verify the complete daily note workflow
- Analytics file auto-updates are normal and don't need to be committed
