# Next Session Instructions - 2025-06-28

## Session Summary
- **Duration**: ~30 minutes  
- **Main focus**: Completed issue #86 - Fixed daily note template inconsistency
- **Issues worked**: #86 (Bug: tp-daily template not being applied consistently)

## Current State
- **Branch**: master
- **Uncommitted changes**: analytics/usage-metrics.json (auto-updated)
- **Work in progress**: None - issue #86 complete

## Completed Today
- ✅ Verified issue #86 implementation against spec
- ✅ Completed todo #10: Updated tool documentation with new template parameters
- ✅ Updated README.md with template system documentation
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with fix details
- ✅ Committed and pushed all changes (commit: bf1e79d)
- ✅ Issue #86 already closed

## Next Priority
1. **Monitor template system in production** - Watch for any edge cases with template processing
2. **Consider v1.8.0 release** - Template system is a significant enhancement
3. **Check failing integration tests** - Tool parity tests were failing, may need attention

## Important Context
- **Template System Architecture**: Implemented comprehensive template management with 24-hour caching
- **Test Coverage**: Full unit and integration tests for template functionality
- **Jest Config Fix**: Fixed moduleNameMapper typo that was preventing tests from running
- **Documentation**: Thoroughly documented template parameters in README

## Technical Details to Remember
- TemplateManager uses 24-hour cache for performance
- ObsidianSettings reads from .obsidian/daily-notes.json and templates.json
- TemplateParser processes Templater syntax (tp.date.now, tp.file.title)
- DateResolver handles relative dates (yesterday, tomorrow, +1, -3)
- VaultUtils.createDailyNote() now uses templates with fallback

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Continue where left off
cd /Users/shayon/DevProjects/mcp-for-lifeos
git status

# Check test status
npm test

# If releasing v1.8.0
npm version minor
git push --tags
```

## Session Notes
- Successfully implemented a major fix for template consistency
- All 10 implementation tasks from issue #86 completed
- System now properly applies tp-daily template to all daily notes
- Knowledge captured in Pieces for future reference
