I have just rebuilt the project using `npm run build` in a different terminal, and have also restarted this Claude Code CLI session with you.

You already have direct access to `lifeos` MCP server. Just use that to test the above implementation yourself. However, and this is important, remember to remove all test artifacts you might end up creating during this test exercise. Especially look into files in the `/Users/shayon/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/LifeOS (iCloud)/05 - Fleeting Notes/` directory since the test suites often end up creating test notes out there, for e.g. test notes for MCP-99.

Let me know if you need more help so as to enable you to test, on your own.
